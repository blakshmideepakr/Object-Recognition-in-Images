In this data science project, the aim is detection of objects from the images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class.

The project was done in google collab, and the following steps have been carried out in the project pipeline: <br>

1. First part of the project consists preprocessing the data for the model development and evaluation. Data preprocessing includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, etc.<br>
2. For the model development, I conducted a deep learning analysis using TensorFlow and Keras. ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network, was implemented for the machine learning training model and analysis, and observed that the algorithm gave the best prediction with an accuracy of 93.4%.
